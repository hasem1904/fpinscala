  * Exercise 6.11: Candy Dispenser.
  *
  * Finite State Automaton that models a simple candy dispenser.
  * The machine has two types of input:
  * 1. You can insert a coin.
  * 2. Or you can turn a knob to dispense a candy.
  *
  * The candy dispenser can be in two states:
  * 1. Locked
  * 2. Unlocked
  *
  * The candy dispenser can also track how many candies are left and how many
  * coins it contains.

    * RÃºnar's explanation:
    * Note the modify functions return type is State[S, Unit]. So the `map (modify[Machine] _ ...`, its an action that transitions
    * some state of type Machine and doesn't yield any return type. `modify` just transitions the state of type S.
    * It doesn't yield a value (hence the return type of Unit).
    * `inputs map (modify[Machine] _ compose update)`. This will give us a list of state actions (List[State[Machine, Unit]]).
    * Then we're calling sequence with those. That will create a single State action that runs all the actions in the list in sequence.
    * Now we have a `State[Machine, List[Unit]]`. A value of type List[Unit] isn't good for anything (except maybe getting its length),
    * so we discard that in the for-comprehension. What we really want is the end state of type Machine.
    * So we call get to retrieve the current Machine and assign that to s. Remember the type of get:
    * You should be able to work out how the for-comprehension desugars to map and flatMap calls:
    * It might help to read `map` and `flatMap` as "append" or "continue with".
    * You have some state-transitioning program, and `map` and `flatMap` append a further program at the end of it.
    *
    *
    * `sequence` takes a list of transitions and combines them into a single transition.
    * Each input type state (Coin/Turn) is then transformed by composing the `modify` and `update` function into on function.
    * Each input state (Coin/Turn) in the list, sets the state of the candy dispenser machine by `modify` function,
    * and then the `update` function is run on the candy dispenser machine (with the new state of the candy dispenser machine returned).
    * Then the final state (after running through the list of input types) of the candy dispenser machine, with the coins and candies is returned
    * as a tuple2.
